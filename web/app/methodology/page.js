            A weekly, queryable feed of what state governments are actually doing, classified by
            which of RAF&apos;s four state-capacity competencies it advances or undermines — with
            most actions landing outside all four, which is expected:

          <ol className="steps">
            <li>
              <strong>Ingest.</strong> Every Monday morning the pipeline fetches {total}{" "}
              state-government news feeds (the full list is below), paging back through each feed
              until it has the past week of articles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pre-screen.</strong> A keyword filter for each competency drops clearly
              irrelevant articles before any model is involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gate 1 — provenance (Claude).</strong> Is the underlying activity an action
              by a <em>state-level</em> government actor in their official capacity?
              Federal-only, city-only, opinion, campaign coverage, and private lawsuits fail here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gate 2 — competency (Claude).</strong> Does it touch one of the four
              capacities — civil service, procedure, digital, or incentives? Survivors carry state,
              activity type, and actor type into the raw feed; the competency itself is finalized
              per-event in the next step.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>De-duplicate &amp; classify.</strong> One government action usually shows up
              across several outlets. A second model pass clusters the articles into distinct events
              (merging every source URL and outlet onto one row — that&apos;s the &ldquo;N articles
              merged&rdquo; note), then classifies each event against RAF&apos;s rubric: its{" "}
              <em>competencies</em> (zero, one, or — when an action genuinely spans two, like
              oversight of a failing IT system — both), a <em>1–3 relevance</em> score for how
              central an example it is (direction-agnostic — undermining a capacity counts as much
              as advancing it), and descriptive <em>topic tags</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surface.</strong> Events accumulate week over week and are what you see on
              the map.

              <strong>Feed retention.</strong> Over half of these feeds hold less than 7 days of
              history. The pipeline pages backwards where the feed supports it, but short
              non-paginating feeds (public radio, some metro dailies) can still lose items between
              weekly runs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Indiana</strong> has only one complementary outlet — most Indiana papers are
              Gannett, which removed RSS.
            </li>

              <strong>Coverage follows the press.</strong> An event only enters the tracker if an
