"""Source registry for the State Activity Tracker.

Three source types (SPEC.md §4):
- STATENEWSROOM_FEEDS — the spine. States Newsroom owned outlets, one per
  state, at https://<domain>/feed/localFeed. All verified live.
- NEWSPAPER_FEEDS — breadth. Up to ~3 complementary outlets per state with
  verified public RSS (nonprofit statehouse outlets, capital dailies, metro
  dailies, business journals). Covers the 11 states States Newsroom misses.
  This is a living list — entries were RSS-verified on 2026-06-09; prune dead
  feeds and add new outlets as found.
- NATIONAL_FEEDS — trade press. No state tag; the classifier infers the state
  from the article. StateScoop is dense digital-pillar coverage.
