"""Source registry for the Ecosystem Writing Tracker.

Curated RAF think-tank and nonprofit partner outlets — Substacks, org blogs,
and standard-CMS publications. All treated as trusted "skim" sources: no
relevance gate, the pipeline enriches everything that passes the content check.

Feed URLs RSS-verified on 2026-06-16 via the Task 0 sweep (ecosystem-tracker-spec
§4). For each candidate the sweep tried the given URL, then fell back through
common patterns (/feed, /feed/, /rss/, /rss.xml, ?format=rss) and HTML
<link rel="alternate"> autodiscovery. The URL recorded below is the one that
resolved to a valid feed with recent entries. This is a living list — re-run the
sweep and prune dead feeds as outlets change CMS.

Held / deferred (NOT in the skim set) — see ECOSYSTEM_HELD and ECOSYSTEM_NO_FEED
below for the record of orgs the sweep could not include in v1.
